# My GitHub-hosted webpages
In this repository, you can find some of the webpages I've created while enrolling on courses or practicing myself. At this moment in time, you can find two different pages:
- My Favorite Albums:
A personal project I did back on winter 2019, when I first started to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's a responsive webpage displaying my top 20 music albums of the year. If you click on an album, a modal will appear with some info and my top 3 tracks from the project.

- My profile page:
A homework I did on my Open Source Software Practice course in Fall 2021. It just displays some basic info about me.
